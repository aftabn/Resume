\location{Sep, 2014 – Sep, 2015 | Burnaby, BC}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Created hardware and software solutions to automate the manufacturing processes involved with building the components of a medical catheter device
\item Designed/updated PCBs using Altium, populated them through surface-mount soldering, and tested them using standard electrical tools
\item Wrote the drivers for the board using Atmel or Arduino microcontrollers in C
\item Created GUI applications that interfaced with the device and many APIs or supporting libraries using C\#
\item Implemented databases using Microsoft SQL Management Studio and Entity Framework with C\# to log data and keep track of calibrations/settings between multiple devices
\item Developed several solutions using PID controllers, threading, timers / interrupts, SPI, thermocouples, watchdogs,
filters, ADCs, USART communication

\descript{| Team Lead, Control System Lead}

\location{January, 2016 - Present}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Designing a 2-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) helicopter with all but the lift and yaw DoF mechanically constrained
\item Developing a closed loop feedback system by implementing a PID controller within a microcontroller that interfaces with sensors to accurately control the position of the helicopter
\item Writing the firmware for the microcontroller in C++ and creating a GUI test interface in C\# to allow for quicker and more efficient calibration, PID tuning and debugging
\item Adding Bluetooth capabilities to the device to allow for wireless PID tuning and flashing of new firmware
\item Creating an android app with a simulated joystick to allow for easy, wireless control of the helicopter
